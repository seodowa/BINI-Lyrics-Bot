    "I saw the line of a thousand other dreams coming true\nNervous faces and heart races\nCan I come through?\nUsed to dance on my own\nThought I was all alone\nThen I found your new faces\nNow I know where my place is\n",
    "When the world was telling me, 'No'\nYou pushed my heart to just go\nAnd now for sure, I know\n",
    "Now here with you, found something new\nThrough the dark nights, the highlights\nYou're my lifeline, as we take our flight\nLet's paint the sky in different lights\nHolding onto all that we could be\nGonna make it bright\n",
    "Opened our eyes, to the rain coming down on sunny days\nSacrifices, compromises\nDo we like the view?\nWould've want to quit the show\nBut with you, we've got a reason to keep going on this road\nNow we know where our place is\n",
    "And no matter what they say to break us, take our spirits down\nWe just need to look around\n"
