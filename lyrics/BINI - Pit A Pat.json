    "Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying\nThere's a fire you can't contain it\nI don't need a boy to save me\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\n",
    "See you watching me from across the room\nIt's so obvious, I got you nervous\nSee you wondering how to get my attention\nYeah, I'm flattered but it doesn't matter\n",
    "I might be young, but I know, I know what I want\nAnd it's not love, I'm not, I'm not in a rush\nYeah, I might laugh along but I'm just being polite\nDon't go thinking I'm yours\nYou're the last thing on my mind\n",
    "Busy tryna give it my everything 'cause life's not\nDisney, I don't need a knight in shining armor\nSo you gotta respect that I got that X Factor\nOh, I'm gonna make it rain, yeah\nUh-uh, let's go\n",
    "Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying\nThere's a fire you can't contain it\nI don't need a boy to save me\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\n",
    "Pit-a-pat, my heart is saying\nIt's my dream I gotta chase it\nI don't see that ever changing\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\n",
    "Make it happen on my own\nGonna be a lonely road\nBut I gotta buckle up, buckle up\nFor the Grand Prix\nAnd this ain't a simple journey\nNo way I'm slowing down\nDo you really think you're worth it?\nBaby in your dreams\n",
    "Pit-a-pat, dapat tapat ka\nKalooban mo'y napakaganda\nSa panahong nadadapa ka\nTumayo't tumakbo at 'wag mag-alala\n",
    "'Di mo na kailangan maghanap ng iba\nNa tutulong sa'yo kapag walang-wala\nKayang-kaya mo 'yan, 'wag na 'wag aatras\n'Di kailangan ng prince charming para maligtas\n",
    "Hey, 'wag ka nang kabahan\n'Di tayo 'yung mga prinsesang 'di kayang lumaban\nAww, pasensya na, nakalaan ang oras ko\nSa mga plano at pangarap\n",
    "For all the girls out there, we can make this worth it\nWe ain't gonna back down, we ain't gonna quit\n'Di man madali maniwala sa sarili\nPit-a-pat, tuloy lumaban at 'ka'y magwawagi\n",
    "Maybe one day I'll be down\nTo let somebody in, even stick around\nCould be you, I'm leaning on\nBut right now, I'm looking out for number one\n"
