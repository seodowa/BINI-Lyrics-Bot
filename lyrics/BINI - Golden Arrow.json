    "Think I've lost my keys again\nMadness out the door\nIt's a Friday night, I'm wishing for a little more\nUnder streetlights 8 PM, let's make this one count\nNo one else but me and my girls\nRunning this whole town\n",
    "Grab the ice cream, go turn the clock\nDance 'til midnight, nobody knock\n",
    "Everybody watch out a storm is coming your way\nWarning signs and flashing lights\nAll of the clich√©s\nFeeling a little nervous with this moments in our hands\nGot nothing to worry about\nTime to take the chance\n",
    "We got, we got, we got tonight to borrow\nWe got, we got, we got this golden arrow\nGrab the ice cream, go turn the clock\nDance 'til midnight, nobody knock\nWe got, we got, we got this golden arrow\n",
    "You can bet, we own the world\nCrown is on our heads (Yeah)\nGo check out the rules and see\nNothing to be said (Nothing to be said)\nIn our own world 1 AM\nPerfect harmony (Hey)\nNo one else but me and my girls (Me and my girls)\nMaking our legacy\n",
    "I gotta take a minute, gotta catch my breath\nI don't care about these limits, ready for your tests\nI got no time, no dime for nothing else\nI got beauty, got strength, I'm the beast of my belle\n",
    "Now it's my time to, pierce my way through\nWith this golden arrow, ain't ever be wasted\nYeah, I'm pushin' and pushin' when I'm on the edge, huh\nFightin' and fightin' 'til I got nothin' left\n",
    "I go-go-gotta just be carefree, just ignore the bad energy\nNobody can stop me 'cause the star belongs to me\nI placed the crown on my head and told myself\nThis is my shot, watch me, I can make it, I can do it (That's right!)\n",
    "Working hard to get to the top\nHope is on the horizon, we BINI ain't gonna stop\nTake your aim, make your mark, fix your eyes on the price\nDon't stop believin', hold the feelin', this fire within\nIs why we're born to win (Woah, oh)\n"
