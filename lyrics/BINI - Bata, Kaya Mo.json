    "Bata, bata, 'wag matakot sa dilim\nMata nilang dilaw na nakatingin\nBata, bata, 'wag matakot harapin\n'Pakita mo kung anong kayang gawin\n", 
    "Dive in the ocean and take that leap\nYou'll come and see that it's not that deep\nGo take my hand and just jump with me\nAy'g kabalaka, let's count to three\n", 
    "Oh, bata, ba't ka nangangamba?\nSumabay sa alon, 'wag matakot, you'll see\nGo with the flow, you can take it slow\nTake your time, keep it light, no pressure, be free\n", 
    "Hard times but don't ever slow down\nStars shine brighter when the sun comes down\nNo stress, bata, keep your head up\nWhen you fall down south, don't forget to stand up\n", 
    "Pain and pressure make a diamond\nRide the waves like Poseidon\nStay humble, stay grinding\nMake the noise, go silent\n", 
    "I'm steppin' on, steppin' on gas\nNot lookin' back, I just wanna go fast\nAin't afraid, I know I'm gonna surpass\nThis time, you'll see me, colors contrast\n", 
    "Bata, won't you come with me?\nSee your dreams, be free\nDili mag-disagree\nPadayon ta diri kay atoa ni\n"
