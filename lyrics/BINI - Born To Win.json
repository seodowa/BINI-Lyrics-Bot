    "Yeah, I felt it, and I've been there through different phases\nI've been feeling like I don't have the power in me\nIt took me a few dead-ends to finally understand\nGot to push harder, the failures only made me strong\n",
    "I used to be so careless, careless\nBut now I'm more than fearless, fearless\nDon't stop yourself 'cause the world is ours\nWe're made to be broken\nBut we won't stop, we won't stop\nSo let me hear it, I'm on it\n",
    "Now every step we take, boundary we break\nThere's nothing we can't do, do, do\nWhen it gets hard to see, just repeat after me\nThere's nothing you can't do, do, do\n",
    "Nothing can hold us back\nLet's make the moment last\nWhat you have within won't fade away\n'Cause baby, we were born to win\n",
    "Listen up, do this, do that\nJust climb up the ladder and give a helping hand\nSometimes it's harder, then all you need is some time\nIt'll take you a few dead-ends to finally understand\nGot to push harder, the failures only make you strong\n",
    "Now, I have found my confidence, confidence\nThere's only one me, yeah\nWe were born to live\nBorn to make mistakes\nEvery boundary we break\nEvery step we take\nTogether we can go facing anything\n(*Listen, baby*)\n"
